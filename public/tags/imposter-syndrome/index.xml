      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saghir Bashir &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ilustat.com/&#34;&gt;(www.ilustat.com)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often have flashbacks to a conversation, as a graduate student, with an
internationally renowned award winning statistician. We had been discussing some
issue for which I was seeking advice. It was a fruitful conversation but then they
finished with something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Saghir, I realise that I don&amp;rsquo;t know
anything about statistics.&amp;rdquo; I was stunned. It hit me so hard that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop
thinking about it for weeks, in fact for years. For months I had been struggling
with a ground breaking publication by the said statistician for which they had
been widely recognised. I asked myself if somebody like that doesn&amp;rsquo;t know
anything what chance do I have. It was one of my first experiences of the
&amp;ldquo;imposter syndrome&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than ten years later I found myself analysing some data with various
challenges. The more I looked the more I saw and everything was going in different
directions. I was struggling to get to grips with the magnitude and complexity
of it all. At some point I stopped and felt that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything.
Immediately my mind flashed back to the conversation and I smiled as I finally
understood it. From that moment onwards something changed. I was free and relieved.
I was no longer trying to swim in an ocean that continuously pushed me under with
its waves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I happily embrace my imposter experiences with a passion for different
reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First and foremost is that the other extreme would be one of arrogance where I
would foolishly believe I knew it all. Bad!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helps me identify gaps in my knowledge, experience and skills which feeds
my desire to continue learning and developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It gives me the adrenaline to do my best much like the nervousness before a presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am forced to focus on what I really need to know given my constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have the power and confidence to consult others without fear and regardless of their
rank or position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helps in connecting the dots betweens areas that I feel I know and those that I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a reminder of all of my achievements and milestones, however small they may seem,
that allow me to feel like an imposter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It empowers me to answer questions with &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It lets me switch off from my work when I am living my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It keeps me human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The renowned statistician had in some sense revealed that they were an &amp;ldquo;imposter&amp;rdquo;.
It was a passive remark without any sense of defeatism or failure. It was matter
of fact. We are all imposters. Let&amp;rsquo;s enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
