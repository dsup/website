# Introduction

R has grown in popularity over the years which can be measured by using different 
metrics, for example, R downloads, the number of packages on CRAN[^cran], participation 
in on-line communities, books published and so forth. This growth brings with it
newcomers who are keen to learn the R programming language.

Learning R, like learning anything else, is a process from which you get what you put 
into it. In this post, I will argue that learning R should be treated like learning a 
spoken (written) language, i.e., as a continuous process without a truly defined end. 
Hereafter I will refer to spoken (written) languages as "spoken languages".

# Learning a Spoken Language

I had different reasons to learn a spoken language, for example, initially 
to learn some basics (e.g. introducing myself, ordering food, asking directions), know 
enough to live in my new country and to engage with my new hosts. I started by
learning to introduce myself (the "Hello world!"[^HelloWorld] phase) and then I built
on that. 

All learning paths require "language immersion" (i.e., actively reading, 
writing and speaking) which by design incorporates making "mistakes" as part of the 
process. It takes courage to start to speak (and write) often with the fear of not knowing 
enough but once you do start you learn to auto-correct and learn from others. The more you 
immerse yourself the braver you become as each new thing learnt feeds the next. Even 
if you have an accent or keep making grammatical mistakes you'll find that in most
situations it won't be too harmful and when they are, hopefully, some kind soul will
inform you or you will realise yourself (e.g. I often realised from the facial
expressions and/or body language).

Spoken languages evolve over time. This can be as a result of changes in vocabulary with 
new words entering the lexicon and "older" ones becoming less popular. The style of the 
language can also change over time and/or between "contexts" (e.g. legalese versus
poetry). These changes force us to "maintain" the language which can be an 
auto-intuitive process that you adapt to quickly (e.g., adopting new words) or require
some updating (e.g. learning, researching).

You could read the previous two paragraphs in the context of "learning R" (or any 
other programming language) as the objectives and the way to achieve them are similar. 
For the remainder of this post I will discuss some common features between learning R 
and a spoken language. 

# Learning R

There are different objectives and motivating factors to learn R. You may, for example, 
want to develop "data science" programming skills to complement your job, make R 
programming part of your day to day work or become an advanced user. All these will 
require developing new skills and maintaining them. There is no one right path to learn 
anything so you should be open to experimenting until you find the things that work for 
you. It will be an emotional journey with highs and lows. There will be fun in mastering
something new and frustration when you spend hours debugging your code to find that you 
forgot a comma or used the wrong case (it'll keep happening... sigh!).

As a newcomer you may feel overwhelmed by all the information about the fancy things 
that R can do. Don't worry even long time users can have that feeling. You may ask but 
"how do you get on top of it?". You don't and most importantly you don't need to. This 
is the same for any spoken language as they have many different "styles", for example,
legalese, poetic, technical, scientific, business, humorous, journalistic to name 
but a few. You don't need to master them all! You could specialise in technical 
writing and dab in a bit of poetry but you do not need to be a master of legalese 
until you have to sign a contract where you might be wiser to consult a lawyer. 
However each of them depends on some common "base grammar" that you use to have 
an understanding of the other domains. This is the "same" for R, there is "Base R" 
around which various ecosystems and packages are built (many of which overlap).

To get started you need to build some base knowledge (i.e. a foundation). For 
both R and a spoken language this could be achieved by doing a course or reading 
a booking. This typically means investing at least a few hours a week or doing an
intensive course over a short period of time (e.g. two weeks). Whichever route you 
take the best rewards come when you immerse yourself as much as possible and use 
making mistakes as learning opportunities. Even making the same mistakes repeatedly
is a good way to revisit and strengthen your knowledge and facilitate your future 
development.

For an "easier" learning path, develop your R knowledge and skills based on what you 
need to do and what interests you (i.e. some form of "specialisation"). The same applies 
to learning a new spoken language. There is nothing wrong with looking at areas that 
interest you but don't overwhelm yourself. It is similar to being a technical writer 
who likes to read poetry. You don't need to master or "understand" poetry to enjoy it. 
It will broaden your horizons and increases your knowledge. You don't have to master 
all the areas as an understanding of the concepts is often enough.

When using a spoken language we all have our own "style" which can change or evolve
over time. The biggest influence on our styles are probably the environment that you 
were exposed to in your earlier life, popular culture and "influencers" in your life.
Your style will naturally change over time and perhaps change more radically due to
some major reason or influence (e.g. after college adopting a "professional" style
for a new job). Regardless of your style you usually do your best to make yourself
understandable to others. The same logic applies to programming. Often there are 
different ways to program the same thing but you should focus on making it readable 
by others (including the future you) rather than trying to make it too "clever". 
Think of it being like people who deliberately (and arguably annoyingly) use obscure
long words. One of the most radical changes in my programming took place early 
in my career when I started to work in a regulated environment where programs had 
to be "reproducible" for both quality and auditing reasons. Knowing that someone 
was or could be watching made me focus harder on making sure my code was readable 
and understandable by others, essentially forcing me to "speak" the same language.

One of the challenges of learning something new is feeling inadequate or inferior 
to others (i.e., the imposter syndrome[^ImposterSyndrome]). The same is true for
spoken languages too. Embrace being an  "imposter" and use it to feed your hunger 
to learn more in a healthy way. Some people will walk in front of you and 
others behind but it doesn't matter so long as you go at your own pace whilst 
enjoying the journey and the view. It is not a competitive event. This is free 
advice from one "imposter" to another.

# Community Learning

Ever since R was released as a free software by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman it has
been a community driven project which can be seen across the various web and R user 
groups. R goes from strength to strength thanks to its community and thanks to the 
excellent R Core team[^RCoreTeam] (who give it a stable and reliable foundation that 
you can trust). Your learning and development depends on this community so embrace it
with open arms. For the most part R community members are polite and helpful. If 
someone is not behaving appropriately there are members who are willing to politely
intervene[^CallOutYihui]. So joining in should be a relatively safe endeavour. How do 
you go about doing this?

First and foremost try to find people around you and build a local/your community with 
them. It does not matter if they have more or less experience than you. The R is 
community driven by people with differing experiences and backgrounds who help one 
another. No single person can know everything. So drop the hierarchy and collaborate 
as a community. 

When you learn a new spoken language you will encounter new words, phrases and/or idioms. 
For these you will probably consult a dictionary, a grammar reference and/or a thesaurus 
(even if they are on-line). They will give you a different depth of understanding whilst
enhancing your development. However, in programming terms, search engines make it easier
to find solutions to your programming problems. One of the side effects of this approach 
is that people blindly copy and paste code without truly understanding it! To get a 
better understanding of R commands and code, use the R built-in help and (package) 
vignettes. They are your dictionary, thesaurus and grammar guides. The more you use 
them the more familiar they will become and the quicker you will become at finding
solutions for yourself. They can also be a saviour when you don't have internet access. 
Having said that I encourage using on-line searches as they can teach you new things 
or reveal other approaches. Try to understand what the code is doing and why by 
simultaneously using the R built-in help and vignettes.


There is so much R related material on-line and in print **THANKS** to the many 
people who make it possible. How do you keep up with it all? You can't and you don't. 
Like with spoken language if you want to follow the news you cannot follow all the 
news sources available which makes you naturally selective. With R you have to do 
the same. For example, over the year I have chopped, changed and narrowed my 
selection down to actively following R Weekly[^Rweekly] and one twitter feed. I feel 
that both of these keep me informed enough to be content. Occasionally I complement 
these with watching some conference videos or reading a book. Pretty light but very 
informative at a level that I can manage without feeling overwhelmed with the added
bonus of suppressing any fears of missing out.

To be immersed in learning a language will mean encountering social or professional
situations where you are confronted with the language in a group setting. For spoken
languages this could be at a dinner, party or coffee (tea) break and for a programming
language at an R user group meeting, conference or on-line. Initially in both 
situations I felt like an alien and was afraid to speak. As I started to engage,
people were kind, helpful and encouraging as many of them were also aliens or 
ex-aliens.


# Summary

Developing your R knowledge, skills and experience can take over your life if you let
it. You could try various tricks or methods to develop more intensively but time and 
human nature are usually the limiting factors. Some intensive methods (e.g. doing a
course, reading a book) can work for a limited duration but to be sustainable treat
learning R like learning a new spoken language. Make it a life (career) project that you
continuously maintain and nurture. Before you know it you will be a fluent R speaker.
