*Saghir Bashir [(www.ilustat.com)](http://www.ilustat.com/)*

I often have flashbacks to a conversation, as a graduate student, with an 
internationally renowned award winning statistician. We had been discussing some 
issue for which I was seeking advice. It was a fruitful conversation but then they 
finished with something along the lines of "Saghir, I realise that I don't know
anything about statistics." I was stunned. It hit me so hard that I couldn't stop 
thinking about it for weeks, in fact for years. For months I had been struggling 
with a ground breaking publication by the said statistician for which they had 
been widely recognised. I asked myself if somebody like that doesn't know 
anything what chance do I have. It was one of my first experiences of the 
"imposter syndrome".

More than ten years later I found myself analysing some data with various 
challenges. The more I looked the more I saw and everything was going in different
directions. I was struggling to get to grips with the magnitude and complexity 
of it all. At some point I stopped and felt that I didn't know anything. 
Immediately my mind flashed back to the conversation and I smiled as I finally 
understood it. From that moment onwards something changed. I was free and relieved. 
I was no longer trying to swim in an ocean that continuously pushed me under with 
its waves. 

Now I happily embrace my imposter experiences with a passion for different 
reasons.

* First and foremost is that the other extreme would be one of arrogance where I 
would foolishly believe I knew it all. Bad!

* It helps me identify gaps in my knowledge, experience and skills which feeds 
my desire to continue learning and developing.

* It gives me the adrenaline to do my best much like the nervousness before a presentation.

* I am forced to focus on what I really need to know given my constraints. 

* I have the power and confidence to consult others without fear and regardless of their 
rank or position.

* It helps in connecting the dots betweens areas that I feel I know and those that I don't know.

* It is a reminder of all of my achievements and milestones, however small they may seem, 
that allow me to feel like an imposter.

* It empowers me to answer questions with "I don't know".

* It lets me switch off from my work when I am living my life.

* It keeps me human.

The renowned statistician had in some sense revealed that they were an "imposter". 
It was a passive remark without any sense of defeatism or failure. It was matter 
of fact. We are all imposters. Let's enjoy it!
